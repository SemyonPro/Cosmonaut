                Space is not empty. A point in outer space is filled with gas,
                dust, a wind of charged particles from the stars, light from
                stars, cosmic rays, radiation left over from the Big Bang,
                gravity, electric and magnetic fields, and neutrinos from
                nuclear reactions.

                Nothing keeps the sun spinning. The sun spins under its own
                inertia and does not need any help to keep it going. Isaac
                Newton observed that objects in motion tend to stay in motion.
                This is called the Law of Inertia. It means that if an object
                is already moving and nothing acts on it to stop it, the
                object will just keep moving under its own inertia. For
                instance, a hockey puck sliding across the parking lot will
                only stop if it hits a wall or if there is enough friction
                acting on it to slow it down to a stop. Without an external
                force like friction or a wall getting in the way, the puck
                will slide forever under its own inertia. The Law of Inertia
                is just a conceptual statement. The more general and more
                mathematical version of the Law of Inertia is called the Law
                of Conservation of Momentum. It states that the total momentum
                of an object stays constant if nothing acts on the object.

                Space is not always cold. It depends if you are facing the sun
                or not. And even if you are in shadow, space is not cold in
                the sense that it will cool you down quickly. The part of an
                astronaut facing the sun becomes blazing hot while the side in
                shadow remains a moderate temperature due to the suits
                internal machinery. Think of how you feel standing close to a
                campfire on a cold night, and you get some of idea of the
                temperatures effects in space. The dark parts of the moon
                reach -410° F while the sunlit parts reach 240° F, as measured
                by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. We don't experience these
                cold and hot extremes on earth because the atmosphere mixes
                around and evens out the temperatures. Planets without
                atmospheres, however, experience these extreme variations.

                The Great Wall of China is not visible to the naked eye from
                space, even in low-earth orbit, according to NASA. Even though
                the wall is very long, it is also very thin, making it
                essentially invisible. In fact, no man-made objects are
                visible from space by the naked eye, according to astronauts.
                The earth is a very big place and human-sized objects are
                miniscule by comparison. With the help of zoom lenses, cameras
                in space can see much finer detail than human eyes. However,
                due to its thinness, the Great Wall of China is not the
                easiest man-made object for a camera in space to spot. If you
                slowly zoom in using a space camera, the Houston airport, for
                instance, is visible long before the Great Wall of China.
                Major highways radiating out like spokes from large cities are
                typically the most visible structures from space for a camera.
                This is because valleys are typically blasted through the
                hills to make way for the straight highways.

                The stars are not fixed, but are constantly moving. If you
                factor out the daily arcing motion of the stars across the sky
                due to the earth's rotation, you end up with a pattern of
                stars that seems to never change. The stars seem so fixed that
                ancient sky-gazers mentally connected the stars into figures
                (constellations) that we can still make out today. But in
                reality, the stars are constantly moving. They are just so far
                away that the naked eye cannot detect their movement. But
                sensitive instruments can detect their movement. Consider
                driving down the highway in the mountains at 60 mph. The
                telephone poles on the side of the road seem to whiz past you,
                but the distant mountains seem to hardly move at all. In fact,
                they are both traveling at the same speed (60 mph) relative to
                you. The mountains just seem to move slower than the telephone
                poles because of a perspective effect known as parallax. In
                general, the more distant an object, the less it moves in your
                field of view for a certain, fixed actual speed. The stars
                (even the closest ones) are vastly farther away than the
                mountains, so their motion in our field of view is miniscule.
                But they are still moving.

                The moon stays approximately the same size, whether measured
                by apparent size or actual size. Actual size is the number you
                would measure if you went to the moon with a long ruler. It
                would take a cataclysmic event such as collision with a planet
                to change the actual size of the moon. Apparent size is the
                angular diameter that an object takes up in a camera's field
                of view and depends on both actual size and distance. The
                apparent size would change if the moon moved significantly
                away from the earth. But it doesn't. According to "The Moon
                Book" by Kim Long, the distance of the moon from the earth
                only changes by about 10%. This means that the observed
                diameter of the moon only changes by 10% throughout the month.
                This small variation of the moon's apparent size is easily
                verified with a camera. We only think the moon looks bigger on
                the horizon because of a psychological trick. When the moon is
                low, we can visually compare it to distant mountains and
                conclude that the moon is much bigger than a mountain. But
                when the moon is high, there is nothing to compare it to, so
                our minds perceive it to be smaller. The exact mechanism is
                still debated by psychologists, as set forth in the book "The
                Moon Illusion" by Maurice Hershenson.

            <div class="panel-content">
              <p>
                There is an up and down in space. "Down" is simply the
                direction gravity is pulling you, and "up" is just the
                opposite direction. Since there is gravity everywhere in
                space, there is also an up and down everywhere in space.
                Gravity is a centrally attractive force, so "going down" means
                falling or being pulled towards the center of the nearest
                massive object. If you are in space and the earth is the
                nearest astronomical object, you fall towards earth. Down is
                therefore towards the earth's center and up is away from the
                earth's center when close to the earth. Down is not towards
                the earth's South Pole and up is not towards the earth's North
                Pole. This mistaken notion comes from the way we traditionally
                hold flat maps. The Nile river would never flow north if north
                were really up. Unfortunately, in an effort to explain why
                north is not up and south is not down, many people conclude
                there is no up or down in space, which is clearly wrong. If
                earth is the closest large body, down is always towards the
                center of the earth and up is always away from the center of
                the earth. Nothing magical happens if you are leave earth's
                surface and board the International Space Station: down is
                still in the same direction.
